Just an old question I've been wanting to investigate for a long
time. Thanks to Sutherland's work, we can compute modular polynomials
modulo a prime for many primes in quasi-optimal time. We also have
algorithms (can't remember if they are quasi-optimal) to compute the
Hilbert class polynomial by _p_-adic lifting.

Is it possible to come out with an algorithm to compute modular
polynomials by _p_-adic lifting, that is optimal, at least for some
(many) primes? This would have some nice applications to isogeny
computation, e.g. the Lercier-Sirvent algorithm.
