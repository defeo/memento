Define a data format (geoJSON-based?) for describing a (road) trip and
spatially/temporally associated objects (identified by URLs?).

Write a (mobile) browser based interface to navigate the data. Ideas
for UI:

- Full screen pannable/zoomable map with plotted track(s).
- Track(s) time/altitude profile view.
- Markers along track(s) for associated objectts.
- Toggleable side/bottom panel showing object previews (large screen only?).
- Dynamic sorting of previews, based on
  - one axis (e.g., time)
  - two axes (e.g., distance from screen middle / mouse pointer)
- Generic 4D -> 2D projection view :D
- Toggleable statistics

Write tools to convert gpx/exif to the data format.
